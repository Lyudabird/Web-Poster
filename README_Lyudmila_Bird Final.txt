OCAD U Web Poster Project Assignment
==========================================================

Designed by Lyudmila Bird

Files Included:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- scrollreveal.min.js

How to Use:
1. Double-click "index.html" to open in any web browser. 
2. No internet connection required — everything works offline with the addition of the scrollreveal.min.js file but
works online as well. You need online connection for the Google Map link to work.
3. Scroll down the page to scroll trigger the animation effects.

Features for my part of the scrolling exercise:
- Snap-scrolling web poster design,which locks the user’s scroll position to each full section as one move down the page
- Scroll triggered fade/zoom animation effects using ScrollReveal
- Scroll responsive sections for speakers, venue, and registration

Notes:
- Make sure all files are in the **same folder**
- Do not remove or rename `scrollreveal.min.js` or the scroll effects won't work
